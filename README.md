# discord-framework

Opinionated discord.js framework

- Does not directly extend any of discord.js's classes, preferring wrapper classes
- Utilizes [06000208/handler](https://github.com/06000208/handler) for modularity
- Utilizes [06000208/commands](https://github.com/06000208/commands/) for commands

This is a work in progress, indicated by using major version 0.
