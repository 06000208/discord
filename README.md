# discord-framework

Opinionated discord.js framework

- Does not directly extend any of discord.js's classes, preferring wrapper classes
- Utilizes [06000208/handler](https://github.com/06000208/handler) for modularity
- Utilizes [06000208/commands](https://github.com/06000208/commands/) for commands

This is a work in progress, indicated by using major version 0.

## Optional Packages

- Refer to [the optional packages](https://www.npmjs.com/package/discord.js#user-content-optional-packages) section of the discord.js readme for optional packages that improve discord.js (make it faster) or add functionality (such as for the discord voice api)

- The sapphire framework provides [several nice utilities](https://github.com/sapphiredev/utilities), such as [discord-utilities](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sapphire/discord-utilities), [ratelimits](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sapphire/ratelimits), [snowflake](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sapphire/snowflake), and [stopwatch](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sapphire/stopwatch)
